**Doctor-R1** is an AI doctor agent trained to conduct strategic, multi-turn patient inquiries to guide its diagnostic decision-making. Unlike traditional models that excel at static medical QA, Doctor-R1 is designed to master the complete, dynamic consultation process, unifying the two core skills of a human physician: communication and clinical reasoning.

## üì∞ News

* **[Oct 5, 2025]** üî• We have released the paper for **Doctor-R1**. Doctor-R1 sets a new state-of-the-art for open-source medical agents (8B) on the challenging **HealthBench** benchmark, outperforming leading proprietary models like GPT-4.1 and Grok-4.
* **[Oct 5, 2025]** üî• On the **MAQuE** benchmark, Doctor-R1 matches GPT-4.1's accuracy while achieving a vastly superior **Empathy** score (93.80 vs. 75.20).
* **[Oct 5, 2025]** üî• Our human evaluation confirms a strong preference for Doctor-R1, which achieves a remarkable **92.5% win rate** in Empathy against strong competitors.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Unified Clinical Skills:** The first agent framework to holistically integrate two core clinical skills, **strategic patient inquiry** and **accurate medical decision-making** within a single model.

* **Experiential Reinforcement Learning:** A novel closed-loop framework where the agent learns and improves from an accumulating repository of its own high-quality experiences.

* **Dual-Competency Reward System:** A sophisticated two-tiered reward architecture that separately optimizes for both conversational quality (soft skills) and diagnostic accuracy (hard skills), featuring a "safety-first" veto system.

* **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Outperforms leading open-source models on challenging dynamic benchmarks like HealthBench and MAQuE with high parameter efficiency.

  

## üèÜ Leaderboards

Doctor-R1 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and surpasses several powerful proprietary models on HealthBench. It demonstrates superior performance on dynamic benchmarks and strong foundational knowledge on static QA tasks.

## üë• Human Evaluation

To validate that our quantitative results align with user experience, we conducted a pairwise human preference evaluation against other leading models. The results show a decisive preference for Doctor-R1, especially in patient-centric metrics.

## üî¨ Ablation Studies

Our ablation studies validate the critical contributions of our framework's key components.

***Impact of Experience Retrieval Mechanism.*** The results show that our full retrieval mechanism with reward and novelty filtering provides a significant performance boost over both a no-experience baseline and a standard similarity-based retrieval, especially in communication skills.

***Impact of Patient Agent Scaling.*** We observe a strong, positive correlation between the number of simulated patient interactions during training and the agent's final performance. This validates that our agentic framework effectively learns and improves from a large volume of diverse experiences.

## üöÄ Code and Model Release (Coming Soon!)

We are in the process of cleaning up and packaging the code and model weights for a public release. We plan to make the following assets available in this repository shortly:

-   [ ] The full source code for our **Experiential Agentic Reinforcement Learning** framework.
-   [ ] Training configurations and evaluation scripts to reproduce our key results.
-   [ ] The final **\textsc{Doctor-R1}** model weights, which will be hosted on the Hugging Face Hub.

Thank you for your interest and patience! Please **star ‚≠ê and watch üëÄ this repository** to be notified of the release.
